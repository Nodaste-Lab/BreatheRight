□ Integrate weather.gov pollen API  
□ Add data caching and offline storage
□ Implement background refresh

Medium Priority:  
□ Add error boundaries for API failures
□ Implement retry logic for network requests
□ Add data validation for API responses
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Medium term - 2-4 weeks)
```
□ Push notifications for air quality alerts
□ Historical data charts (7-day trends)
□ Personalized health recommendations based on user concerns
□ Weather forecast integration
□ Improved accessibility features
```

### Phase 3: Production Deployment (4-6 weeks)
```
